Description: IPMpack takes demographic vital rates and (optionally) 
    environmental data to build integral projection models. 
    A number of functional forms for growth and survival can be 
    incorporated, as well as a range of reproductive strategies.  
    The package also includes a suite of diagnostic routines, 
    provides classic matrix model output (e.g., lambda, elasticities,
    sensitivities), and produces post-hoc metrics (e.g., passage time 
    and life expectancy).
